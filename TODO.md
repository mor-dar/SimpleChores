### TODO
- Nice to have: Implement category/tags for chores (specific tags which would be nice: Morning, Evening)
- Better visuals than the current todo list.  Colorful buttons for recurring tasks that the younger kids can easily identify and interact with.
- Verify the per chore approval/rejection flow works correctly
- When de-selecting a pending chore, it should be removed from pending status (similar to a parent rejecting it).
- How are pending chores approved?  Can you give me an example dashboard item for selection and approval of a pending chore?
- On home assistant restart the chores seem to be reset, this is an issue.  Can we make them persist between restarts?
