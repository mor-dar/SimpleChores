### TODO
- Nice to have: Implement category/tags for chores (specific tags which would be nice: Morning, Evening)
- Better visuals than the current todo list.  Colorful buttons for recurring tasks that the younger kids can easily identify and interact with.
- Verify the per chore approval/rejection flow works correctly
